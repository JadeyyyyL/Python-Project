# 1. The Big Idea: 

This project proposes the development of a comprehensive dashboard utilizing the Billboard API to provide users with easy access to recent music trends and popular songs. Users will be able to explore the top 100 songs, with a focus on female singers, track popularity trends over time, and even set up personalized alerts for specific songs. Additionally, a stretch goal includes the development of an iPhone widget for convenient access to music trends on-the-go.

# 2. Learning Objectives

From a marketing perspective, we hope to gain insights into how music trends and popular tastes evolve over time. Through this process, we could analyze the factors influencing changes in music preferences and the impact of cultural shifts on the music industry. 
    
From coding perspective, we hope to be able to develop a user-friendly dashboard interface that aggregates data from the Billboard API, entirely by ourselves. We could enhance our coding skills by exploring different techniques for data visualization and user interaction to enrich the overall user experience. 
    
From a group project perspective, we hope to ain experience in project planning, execution, and collaboration as part of a team. Learn to prioritize tasks, allocate resources effectively, and overcome challenges encountered during the development process.

# 3. Implementation Plan

We would need to use Billboard API for retrieving music data. We would need to split the work into frontend and backend frameworks, that includes HTML5 and CSS3, flask and requests. Moreover, because we want to visualize the data, we would to try using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly or Bokeh libraries and select the ones that best serve our needs.

# 4. Project Schedule

Week 1: API Integration
Week 2: Building the interactive dashboard interface
Weel 3: Data management and building functions in Python
Week 4: Testing and integrating the frontend and backend libraries


# 5. Collaboration Plan

The members will meet at least twice a week to work on the objectives based on the schedule. Jade will focus on building the user interface, ensuring that the dashboard is visually appealing, intuitive to use, and aligns with user requirements. Meanwhile, Yuefan will be responsible for visualizing the data using Python, leveraging libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to create interactive and informative charts and graphs. Both members are aware of each other's schedule and would be willing to accomodate to online meetings if needed. Jade and Yuefan will maintain open lines of communication, regularly sharing updates, seeking feedback, and collaborating on decision-making to ensure that the project stays on track and meets its objectives. Agile development promotes a sense of shared ownership among team members, fostering a collaborative and supportive environment where everyone is responsible for the project's success. Jade and Yuefan will work together closely, leveraging each other's strengths and expertise to deliver a high-quality product.

# 6. Risks and Limitations

The primary threat to the project's success lies in the limited timeframe of roughly 4 weeks. To address this challenge, the team will prioritize essential features for the website's functionality and user experience. Through iterative development, tasks will be broken down into manageable segments, with each iteration focusing on completing high-impact features. Regular communication and collaboration between Jade and Yuefan will ensure efficient progress, allowing the team to meet the project deadline while delivering a website that successfully visualizes music trends for users.

# 7. Additional Course Content

Our team recognizes the importance of enhancing our skills and knowledge in creating interactive and user-friendly dashboards to bolster our confidence in successfully executing this project. We understand that acquiring a deeper understanding of data visualization methods and learning how to effectively utilize relevant libraries in Python will be instrumental in developing an engaging and informative dashboard for users. By delving into course content that covers these topics, we could gain practical insights and hands-on experience that will enable us to implement dynamic visualizations and user interfaces tailored to the needs of our project.
