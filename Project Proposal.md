# 1. The Big Idea: 

    This project proposes the development of a comprehensive dashboard utilizing the Billboard API to provide users with easy access to recent music trends and popular songs. Users will be able to explore the top 100 songs, with a focus on female singers, track popularity trends over time, and even set up personalized alerts for specific songs. Additionally, a stretch goal includes the development of an iPhone widget for convenient access to music trends on-the-go.

# 3. Implementation Plan
This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further.


# 4. Project Schedule
You have 6 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Draft a general timeline for your project. Depending on your project, you might be able to provide a detailed schedule or only an overview. Preparation of a longer project is also accompanied by present uncertainty, and this schedule will likely require revisions as the project progresses.


# 5. Collaboration Plan
How will you collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you divide tasks and then incorporate them separately? Will you undertake a comprehensive pair program? Explain how you'll ensure effective team collaboration. This may also entail information on any software development methodologies you anticipate using (e.g. agile development). Be sure to clarify why you've picked this specific organizational structure.
