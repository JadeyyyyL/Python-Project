# Instruction:
Accessing the Website:
- Open your web browser and navigate to the URL of our website.
- Upon arrival, you'll land on the homepage.

# Submitting Your Current Mood:
- Type your current mood or emotions into the provided input field.
- In our code, we made our Natural Language Processor to have the ability to understand many types of user inputs. For example, to convey the phrase "So Happy", a user can input "SooOO HapPPpYYyy", and our NLP can still process this input. Additionally, emoji's can also be processed by converting it to the name of emoji icon.
- Click the submit button to proceed.

# Results Page:
- After submitting your mood, you'll be redirected to a results page (results.html).
- This page displays a randomly selected song based on your input mood.


# Listening to Song:
- On the results page, you'll find the details of the selected song, including the song name, artist album, and Spotify URL.
- Click on the Spotify URL to listen to the song on Spotify.

# Error Handling:
- In case of any errors or issues, such as a page not found or internal server error, you'll be directed to an error page (error_page.html).
- The error page provides information about the encountered error and possible next steps.

# Further Improvement:
- To enhance the website further, we could integrate a page dedicated to recommending related artists. The functionality for this already exists in spotify.py, but it hasn't been implemented on the website yet.
